      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>The Velvet Fork was born from a dream shared between two childhood friends, Nadia and Malik, who grew up in the heart of Harlem, where food was more than just nourishmentâ€”it was a celebration of culture, family, and history. In 2015, they opened the doors to a dining experience that would blend Southern comfort with elevated luxury, paying homage to their roots while redefining fine dining. Each dish tells a story, from the bold spices passed down through generations to the smooth, velvety textures inspired by their love of art and elegance. Today, the Velvet Fork stands as a beacon of Black excellence, offering not just a meal, but an experience where every bite is infused with pride and legacy.</p>
